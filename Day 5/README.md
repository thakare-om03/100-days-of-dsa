## Day 5: Displaying Famous Patterns in Java

Today, I learned about displaying famous patterns in Java, such as star and pyramid patterns, using loops.

Here's what I learned:

- Loops:
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - do while loop

- Break and Continue Statements:
    - The `break;` statement stops the iteration.
    - The `continue;` statement skips the current iteration.
