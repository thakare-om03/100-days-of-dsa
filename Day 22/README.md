## Day 22: Sets in the Java Collections Framework

Today's study delved into Sets within the Java Collections Framework. Sets provide unique functionalities for managing collections of elements.

* **Sets:**
   * Unordered collections that contain unique elements (no duplicates allowed).
   * Useful for representing collections where each element matters only once (e.g., removing duplicates from a list).

* **Java's Set Interface and Implementations:**
   * The `Set` interface in `java.util` defines core Set operations.
   * Common implementations include:
     * `HashSet`: Most popular choice for general-purpose Sets, offering average performance due to its hashing mechanism.
     * `TreeSet`: Maintains elements in a sorted order, enabling efficient retrieval based on order.
     * `LinkedHashSet`: Maintains the insertion order while providing uniqueness, useful when order preservation is important.

* **Basic Set Operations:**
   * `add(element)`: Attempts to add an element to the Set. Returns `true` if successful (element wasn't already present), `false` otherwise.
   * `contains(element)`: Checks if a specific element exists in the Set.
   * `remove(element)`: Tries to remove an element from the Set. Returns `true` if removed, `false` if not found.
