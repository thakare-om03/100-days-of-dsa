## Day 3: Conditional Statements in Java

Today's focus was on conditional statements, a fundamental concept that controls the flow of your program based on specific conditions. I explored various conditional structures in Java:

 - ## if-else statements:
 These statements allow you to execute code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.
 - ## else-if statements:
 These statements extend the if-else structure by allowing you to check for multiple conditions sequentially
 - ## switch statements:
These statements evaluate an expression and execute different code blocks based on the matching case value.
 - ## ternary operator: 
This operator provides a concise way to write an if-else statement in a single line.
