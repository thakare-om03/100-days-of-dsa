# Day 2 - Operators in Java

## Overview
On the second day of my journey I explored various operators and their applications. I learned about the intricacies of arithmetic, conditional, and assignment operators, and how they can be used to manipulate data and control the flow of the program.

## Concepts Mastered

- The use of arithmetic operators for basic mathematical operations.
- The significance of operator precedence and how it affects the evaluation of expressions.
- Implementing conditional logic using relational and logical operators.
- Employing assignment operators to simplify and shorten code.

That's all for Day 2!
