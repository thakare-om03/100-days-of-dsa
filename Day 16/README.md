## Day 16: Stacks in Java Collections Framework

Building on yesterday's exploration of Array Lists, today I delved into Basic of Stacks within the Java Collections Framework. Here's what I learned:

* **Stacks:**
  * LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structures.
  * Elements are added and removed following the principle of a stack of plates - the last one added is the first one removed.
* **Stack Class:**
  * Java provides the `Stack` class (part of `java.util`) to implement stacks.
  * Extends the `Vector` class (considered less efficient for modern development).
* **Stack Operations:**
  * `push(element)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  * `pop()`: Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.
  * `peek()`: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
  * `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.
